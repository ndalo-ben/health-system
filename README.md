# Health System Platform

This project is a **Health System Platform** built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://react.dev/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It allows users to:

- **Create health programs** by providing a program name and description.
- **Manage client profiles**.
- **Enroll clients into health programs**.
- **View client profiles and their program enrollments**.

The platform uses Supabase for the backend and provides a clean, responsive, and modern interface for managing health programs and client records.
